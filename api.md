# API ideas

* Favor declarative verbs
* Idempotent all the things
* Dry-run support
* Use API names of underlying systems e.g. `fs` package from Node.js

### `<WriteFile>`

if they've already got this package installed or if another recipe in their stack will install it.

  setup an integration with Contentful before you can add content types.

### `<Meta>`

Tell the recipe interpreter stuff

```jsx
<Meta stepType="example" />
```
