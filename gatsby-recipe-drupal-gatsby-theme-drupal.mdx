# Build a blog with gatsby-theme-blog & Drupal

This recipe helps you setup Drupal to work with gatsby-theme-blog.

<Config
  name="gatsbys/setup-drupal-gatsby-theme-blog"
  requires="gatsbyjs/setup-drupal"
/>

---

First create the content type in Drupal.

import schema from "gatsby-theme-blog/schema"
import { ServerLink, SetupSchemaMapping } from "gatsby-source-drupal"

<ServerLink to="/admin/content-types">Drupal Content Types Admin Page</ServerLink>

The content type needs to look like the following.

<RenderSchema schema={schema} />
<SetupSchemaMapping schema={schema} />

---

For Gatsby to see the new content type, we'll need to restart the local
development process. When it restarts, this recipe will automatically come back
to this point.

<RestartGatsbyDev />

---

import schema from "gatsby-theme-blog/schema"

// Prints error if there's a problem and asks the person to go back a step.
<VerifySchema
  schema={schema}
/>

---

Happy blogging!
