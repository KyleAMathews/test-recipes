Create a dataset on Sanity. A dataset is where all you store all your content,
kind of like a database. You can have more than one dataset. Just re-run this
card to add more datasets!

import CreateDataset from "gatsby-source-sanity/create-dataset"

// Connects you to Sanity, setups dataset, gets tokens & dataset name and
// saves them as env variables and in a local config store Gatsby can access.
<CreateDataset />
