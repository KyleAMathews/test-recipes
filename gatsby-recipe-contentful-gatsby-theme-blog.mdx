# Build a blog with gatsby-theme-blog & Contentful

This recipe helps you setup Contentful to work with gatsby-theme-blog. Don't worry!
Thanks to Contentful's APIs, it's mostly automatic!

<Config
  name="contentful/setup-gatsby-theme-blog"
  dependencies="contentful/setup-contentful"
/>

---

Installing the `gatsby-theme-blog` package and creating the "Blog"
content type on Contentful.

import { ProvisionType } from "gatsby-source-contentful"
import schema from "gatsby-theme-blog/schema"

// This sets up the content type w/ some example data
// + creates the schema mapping locally to map back to the generic type.
<ProvisionType
  schema={schema}
/>

---

Adding gatsby-theme-blog to your gatsby-config.js


<InstallGatsbyPlugin
  name="gatsby-theme-blog"
/>

---

For Gatsby to see the new content type and use the theme, we'll need to restart
the local development process. When it restarts, this recipe will automatically
come back to this point.
